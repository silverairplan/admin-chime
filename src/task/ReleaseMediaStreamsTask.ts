    // We can't fix it within the current API because CSST only knows about
    // `MediaStreamBroker`, not about `DeviceController` â€” it only knows how
    // to release media streams that are tracked in the
    // `AudioVideoControllerState`, not how to unselect a device.
    //
    // The issue here is that we now work with much more than streams, and
    // this API hasn't kept pace with the complexity of the rest of the SDK.
    //
    // It's currently up to the developer's application to manage which device
    // is currently selected and `DDC` has to figure out from the stream
    // passed here which device to clean up.
    //
    // This can be addressed in a future v3.0.
